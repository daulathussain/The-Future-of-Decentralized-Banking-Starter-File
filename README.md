## Project Overview

Build & Deploy the Future of Decentralized Banking | Solidity DeFi Web3 Banking DApp Project 2026

In this complete Web3 development breakdown, we build and deploy a Decentralized Banking DApp Project using Solidity, DeFi protocols, and modern blockchain architecture.

This project demonstrates how the future of banking can run fully on-chain — without traditional banks — powered by smart contracts and decentralized finance.

Inside this Web3 Banking DApp Project, you will learn how to:

✅ Design and deploy smart contracts using Solidity
✅ Implement core DeFi banking features (deposit, withdraw, lending logic)
✅ Connect frontend with blockchain
✅ Integrate wallet authentication
✅ Deploy the DApp to a live network
✅ Build a scalable decentralized banking protocol

This is a production-level blockchain banking system showcasing how decentralized finance is transforming global financial infrastructure.

Perfect for:

• Web3 Developers
• Solidity Developers
• Blockchain Engineers
• DeFi Builders
• Students building advanced Web3 projects

🚀 Tech Stack:

- Solidity
- Smart Contracts
- DeFi Architecture
- Web3.js / Ethers.js
- Next.js
- MetaMask Integration

If you're serious about building next-generation financial applications in Web3, this is a must-build project for 2026.
